	<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center; color: #000">Much More Than Saving on Electricity Bills</p>
	<p class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">By installing solar panels in your home, you will save much more than
	direct savings on your electric bills. In addition, the value of your
	property will also increase by a significant amount. In a timespan of
	5-10 years, you will most likely recover your investment, and you will
	also gain more than three times your investment considering the long
	life of solar panels. The best thing about installing solar panels is
	that you will be oblivious of the increase in cost of electricity in
	coming years. You can continue using electricity at the same cost and
	even at the times when the local and national electricity grid is down.
	It makes more sense to invest in solar power taking all these factors
	into consideration.. The initial investment may be on the higher side,
	but you will save thousands of rupee and enjoy uninterrupted supply of
	power in the long run. </p>
